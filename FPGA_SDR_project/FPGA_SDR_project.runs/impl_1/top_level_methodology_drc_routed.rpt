Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1000 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.513 ns between adjust_frequency/center_frequency_out_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1) and fft_histogram/current_freq_reg[18]/D (clocked by clk_out2_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
